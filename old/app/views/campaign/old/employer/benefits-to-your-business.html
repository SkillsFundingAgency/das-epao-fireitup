                              Apprenticeships have moved on from what they used to be and are an exciting option for
                              both apprentice and employer.
                              You can now employ apprentices at all different levels, from school leavers to people
                              that want to further their careers or change career direction completely.
                              An apprentice can be aged 16 or 100 plus!
                          </p>

                          <p>
                               As an employer, you can get additional help with funding an apprentice from the government.
