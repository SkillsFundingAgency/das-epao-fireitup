                              Taking on an apprentice, whatever age, will need some preparation from you, as the employer.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              If the new apprentice is straight out of school then they may have limited
                              experience of what's expected of them going into their first salaried job.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              If your new apprentice is older and more experienced they might not need as
                              much help as the school leaver, but they may still be nervous and unsure of whatâ€™s expected of them.
                          </p>

                          <h2 class="heading-m" id="heading1">Preparing</h2>

                          <p>
                              Before an apprentice starts you should consider sending them a
                              starter pack so they know what to expect from their first day.
                          </p>

                          <p>
                              It could include:
                          </p>

                          <ul class="list list--bullet list--bullet-employer">
                              <li>a list of what you'd like them to bring - notebook/pens/ID etc</li>
                              <li>what time you'd like them to arrive</li>
                              <li>how they should dress</li>
                              <li>how much money they need to bring for lunch etc</li>
                              <li>who they should ask for when they arrive</li>
                              <li>where to get the bus/train or park their car</li>
                          </ul>

                          <p>
                              It's important as an employer to support your new apprentice and keep in regular contact with them.
                              Perhaps you could consider:
                          </p>

                              <li>assigning a member of staff to be their daily 'go-to' person</li>
