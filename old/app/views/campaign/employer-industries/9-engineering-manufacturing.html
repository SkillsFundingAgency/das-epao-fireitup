                                        The apprenticeship I'm currently on was one of the best opportunities I had come across.
                                        I had no clue what I wanted to do for a job.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                        I knew further education wasn't for me,
                                        but I couldn't think of anything else I would love. As soon as I saw the advert for my
                                        apprenticeship, I just knew it was perfect.
                                   </p>
                                   <p>
                                        I'd be working with chocolate and learning
                                        the skills created hundreds of years ago with one of the biggest food and drink companies
                                        in the world. When I saw that, alongside the apprenticeship, I would also be working to get
                                        a degree, I was over the moon! It seemed to be the best of both worlds while also earning a wage.

                              We resource our strategic workforce plan because we work in a very specialised area and need to train people
                              specifically for the roles. Without apprentices, we wouldn't be able to find the people we need.

                              Everyone thinks it is an amazing opportunity and think it's brilliant that employers support
                              apprenticeships. My Mum was so proud when I started my degree course and knew that the
                              apprenticeships enabled me to achieve this.
