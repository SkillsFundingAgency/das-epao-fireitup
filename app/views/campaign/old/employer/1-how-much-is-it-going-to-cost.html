                              You can get help from the government to pay for apprenticeship training and assessment.
                              The amount you get depends on whether you pay the apprenticeship levy or not.
                              You will pay the apprenticeship levy if you're an employer with a pay bill over £3 million each year.

                          <p>
                              Apprenticeship funding is a devolved matter and so how you get your funds and pay
