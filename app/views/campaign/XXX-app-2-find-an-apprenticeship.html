                        <p>It's a real job,  with hands-on experience, a salary and the chance to train while you work. You get the same as other employees - a contract of employment, holiday leave, even sick pay.</p>
                        <p>If you're 16 or over, you can become an apprentice as long as you live in England and aren't in full-time education.</p>

                            <li>You get paid and learn at the same time, with at least 20% of your time set aside for learning - usually at a college, university or a training provider.</li>
                            <li>You study for an official certification of your skills, equivalent to a qualification ranging from level two (equivalent to GCSE) all the way up to degree level.</li>
                            <li>You're on a career path, which has real potential for a higher salary and great prospects. </li>

                        <p>Your apprenticeship can take between one and five years to complete, depending on which one, and which level, you choose.</p>
                        <p>Different apprenticeships are available all over England, at companies large and small, in a wide range of industries and organisations. From local businesses to large national brands.</p>
                        <p>We've made some massive improvements to apprenticeships recently. They're no longer 'the easy option' - studying and working takes lots of effort and focus. Degree apprenticeships are now recognised as genuine, credible alternatives to full-time university courses.</p>
