                              Your apprenticeship can take between one and five years to complete, depending on which one, and which level, you choose.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Different apprenticeships are available all over England, at companies large and small, in a wide range of industries and organisations. From local businesses to large national brands.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              We've made some massive improvements to apprenticeships recently.
                              They're hard, rewarding work, taking plenty of effort and focus.
                              Degree apprenticeships are now recognised as genuine, credible alternatives to full-time university courses.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                              Completing your apprenticeship means you've earned and learned,
                              and you'll have a valuable qualification. As your training is fully funded,
                              and you receive a regular salary,
                              it's easy to see why apprenticeships are now an attractive alternative.

                              There are hundreds of different apprenticeships to choose from. Whether you’re at the start of your career, want to change career direction, or if you’re returning to work after a break. We have the apprenticeships for you.

                              Degree apprenticeships offer the benefits of higher education, with none of the cost.
                              Apprentices earn a salary right from day one of their employment and training.
                              Your tuition fees are covered and paid in full, so you have the potential
                              to finish without having to pay off your tuition fees.
